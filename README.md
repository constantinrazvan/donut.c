# donut.c

<h1> Thanks to A1k0n's code! </h1>
<p>When I started coding, I didn't know about this code, but over time I saw that it became very popular. Many developers have talked about this code, (for example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY">Lex Fridman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI">Joma Tech</a>), so I tried to solve it myself, and after a very long time, in which I forgot but I also remembered code, I managed to find the solution.
So, voila! </p>

<h3> I hope you will like it and you could find out the solution for the rotating donut! </h3>
